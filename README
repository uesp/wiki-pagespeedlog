PageSpeedLog
Dave Humphrey (dave@uesp.net)

PageSpeedLog is a MediaWiki extension that logs the wiki page render times to a log file for
further monitoring or debugging. It was created specifically for the UESP.net wiki but should
work with most other MediaWiki installations.

INSTALLATION:
1. Copy extension to your wiki's "/extensions/PageSpeedLog/" directory.
2. Set the $wgPageSpeedLogFile global to where you wish to save the logs. Default is
		/var/log/httpd/pagespeed.log
   and it needs to be writable by your web server.
3. Add the line:
		wfLoadExtension( "PageSpeedLog" );
   to your LocalSettings.php file.
4. Test by visting your wiki and then look at the page speed log files for entries of the form:

		1587137327.0196, 73.055982589722, en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page

   which is the timestamp in seconds, server render time in ms and the URL. Note that the URL will be blank
   for wiki scripts run from the command line.
5. Basic stats can be seen from the Special:PageSpeedLog article on your wiki.
6. You should setup log rotation of the page speed log file to ensure it doesn't get too large.
   It may be already rotated by your Apache log rotation.
7. Setup monitoring of the page speed log as needed. the "scripts/ComputePageSpeedStats.php" file
   shows an example of loading from the log and computing some average stats from it.
